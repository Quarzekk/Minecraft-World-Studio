Minecraft World Studio
======================

Minecraft World Studio is an evolving program designed to enhance the construction of Minecraft worlds through a three-dimensional studio interface. This is targeted towards the mapmaker and the general player.

Minecraft World Studio is written in Java and is based on the [Lightweight Java Game Library](http://www.lwjgl.org/), the same software Minecraft itself is based on.

This readme will be expanded, if not rewritten, in the forseeable future. It is here to display a few plans (in the following, appropriately named section, *A Few Plans*) for the program and to make GitHub stop complaining ;D.

A Few Plans
-----------

Minecraft World Studio is expected to include the following:

* A three-dimensional interface for manipulating blocks and entities (of course)
* Support for standard Minecraft resource packs and older texture packs
* Support for custom fonts via Java AWT
* Support for scripting languages with an integrated script editor
